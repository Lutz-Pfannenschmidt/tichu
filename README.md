### Tichu is a popular chinese card game.
It is a trick-taking game, similar to games like Bridge or Skat. The game is played with a deck of 56 cards, consisting of the 52 cards of the standard French deck and four special cards. The game is played by four players in fixed partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other.

**_Here is a quick refresh:_**

#### The Cards

Similar to the western card decks there are four colors `Red` `Green` `Blue` and `Black`, with `13` cards each.
`2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A`.  
Furthermore, there are four special cards: `Mah Jong`, `Dog`, `Phoenix`and `Dragon`.

#### The Teams

The two teams' players sit across from their teammate so that play alternates between the two teams.
One may try to help his teammate to get play or points.

#### Preparation

* Each player is dealt 8 cards
    * One may call `Grand Tichu`, a 200-point bet that they _(not their teammate)_ will be the first to get rid of all cards.
* Then all players are dealt another 6 Cards.
    * They now may call a `Small Tichu`, a smaller bet, worth _only_ 100 points, that they will be first to get rid of all cards.
* Then the players do a simultaneous exchange
    * They prepare three cards to each other player, the two opponents and the one teammate.

#### The Game

The player with th `Mah Jong` leads the first trick.
<details><summary>  
When it's your turn, you may play a `single card`, a `pair`, a `triple`, a `full house`, a `straight` or a `bomb`.
</summary>

* A `single card` is just one card.
* A `pair` is two cards of the same rank.
* A `triple` is three cards of the same rank.
* A `full house` is a triple and a pair.
* A `straight` are five or more cards of consecutive rank, regardless of suit/color
* A `straight pair` is two or more pairs of at least two cards of consecutive rank, regardless of suit/color (2,2,3,3,4,4 or 6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7)
* A `Bomb` is one of the following:
  * Four of a kind
  * A straight flush of at least five cards

</details>

With the exception of `bombing` cards can only be followed by a similar combination of higher value (single card on single card, pair on pair, etc.).
`Bombs` may be played at any time, _even out of turn_, to end a trick, with every player given a chance to play a higher bomb.

<details><summary>
The special cards
</summary>

* `Mah Jong` The player with this card leads the first trick, but is not required to play it in the trick. 
  When playing, the player may make a wish for a card (`2`-`A`) The wish remains active until it is fulfilled.
  A player who can fulfill the request must do so. If the wished card requires you to play a bomb, you must.
  If `Mah Jong` opens a trick as a `straight`, the next player must, if possible, play a `straight` containing the wished value. 
  If such straight is only possible using the `Phoenix`, the player must play the `straight`using the `Phoenix` as a wild 
  card, **NOT** the wished value. 
* `The Dog` has no numeric value, and cannot be played in a trick. The `Dog` must be played as the lead card, and passes the lead to your teammate.
  It is not possible to steal the lead in any way, as such, bombing the `Dog` is not allowed.
* `The Phoenix` may be played alone as a `.5` higher than the last card played, or as a wild card in a `straight` or `full house`.
  When played as a wild card, it takes the value of the card it is replacing.
  It cannot be played in a bomb, is not a wild card in single play and not .5 higher in a `straight`.
* `The Dragon` is the highest card in the game, and can only be played as a single card. Only a bomb can be higher.
The `Dragon` passes the play to a player of choice from the opposing team.
When bombed, the player with the highest bomb gains the entire trick. 
It is impossible to use the `Dragon` to win the `Dog`.

</details>

If you can't or don't want to play, you may pass.
A trick ends, if passed three times consecutively.
The game ends immediately, if only one player has cards left.

#### Scoring

for counting, first the last player with cards on his hand gives
- his remaining cards to the opposing team
- his tricks to the player who first got rid of his hand cards

Then the teams count their tricks as follows:

| card    | points |
|---------|-------:|
| K & 10  |     10 |
| 5       |      5 |
| Dragon  |     25 |
| Phoenix |    -25 |

_The entire deck is worth 100 points, split between the teams._

Also, the following bonuses are awarded:
- `Grand Tichu` +200 if fulfilled, -200 if not
- `Small Tichu` +100 if fulfilled, -100 if not
- If both players of a team were first & second to get rid of their cards, they get 200 points

#### Winning

To win the game, a team must reach `1000` points.

### Tips
<details><summary></summary>

For tips one may ask the next best chinese bus driver. If such is not available, here are some tips:
- Try to get rid of low cards (single cards and pairs) early.
- Support a teammate's Tichu, as it is worth a lot of points.
- Try to prevent an opponent's Tichu.
- Always keep an eye on the game score. It may be worth to call a Grand Tichu if the other team is close to winning.

### FAQ
<details><summary></summary>

> No, bombs cannot steal the lead.  
> Yes, a Bomb can always be played, even if it's not your turn.  
> Yes, after all players passed the trick, it can still be bombed.  
> Yes, the Mah Jong's wish must be fulfilled, if possible.  
> No, if you cannot fulfill the wish, can play whatever you like.  
> No, a bombed dragon does not have to give away the trick. It isn't his.  
> 
> What happens if multiple players try to bomb and play cards at the same time?  
> * Tichu is not supposed to be a reaction game. Bombs are played before normal combinations. If multiple bombs are played, they may be played in direction of play.  
> * But: it is not allowed to wait what is played and then decide to bomb or not. You may not wait five seconds for someone to play a dragon, and then decide to bomb before it 'was' played. If one wants to think for longer time, he may announce that. 
> * The correct order looks like this:
>>   * Player 1 plays a card
>>   * Player 2 may bomb, Player 3 may bomb, Player 4 may bomb, Player 1 may bomb
>>   * Player 2 plays a card or passes
>>   * Player 3 may bomb, Player 4 may bomb, Player 1 may bomb, Player 2 may bomb
>>   * Player 3 plays a card or passes
>>   * Player 4 may bomb, Player 1 may bomb, Player 2 may bomb, Player 3 may bomb
>>   * Player 4 plays a card or passes
>>   * Player 1 may bomb, Player 2 may bomb, Player 3 may bomb, Player 4 may bomb
>>   * etc.
>   * It is of course inconvenient to always, in the respective order, say "I don't want to bomb". But it is the base principle of the game.
